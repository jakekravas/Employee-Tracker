# Employee-Tracker

Employee Tracker is a command line application that involves a database, created through MySQL, that contains a variety of employee data, such as their names, roles within the company, and department in which they work in. The user is given options to view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add departments, add roles, add employees, and update employee roles. All of the data that the user sees and interacts with is from the database, and any changes that the user makes through this application will reflect in the database as well.
